## Installation
In order to run this program you will need a code editor, either VS code or something similar. Once opening the server.js file, install all dependencies using 'npm i'. From there start the app using 'npm start' this will build your models on MongoDB and make all routes live on your local server. 

## Usage 
As this is a back-end only app use will need an API design platform such as Insomnia to view all the applcable routes. The app is setup for get, post, put and delete routes for the following paths
<p>
- api/users
- api/thoughts

<p>
Once making a user, friends can be added to the user, thoughts can be added to the user and reactions can be added to each thought. Each can also be updated and deleted.
